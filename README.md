The Fucking Weather for Android
===============================

TFWfA is an (unofficial) app to fill the void of profanity-ridden weather notifications on Android smartphones. While currently in active development, the app can currently inform you of the fucking weather at your current fucking location.

Building
--------

Building TFWfA is pretty straightforward. The only things you'll need are android-support-v4.jar and jsoup-1.7.1.jar in the libs/ directory (use the Google if you don't know where to find these). After that, it should build like any Android application.

Building is Hard
----------------

For those of you that can't grasp the intricacies of pushing the "Build" button in Eclipse, don't despair: A build of this app will be coming to the Play Store soon, once I'm happy calling it 1.0.

I really can't help you

License
-------

Well, so far my net investment in this project is one night of bourbon-fueled coding, so it's not like I care too much (besides, TFW.com already did the heavy lifting). Let's say GPLv2

I don't know what that means
